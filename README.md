| :zap: This code is written for the DERO Stargate RC2 testnet. As such, compatibility with future versions of the blockchain is not guaranteed.
The code has been written to provide a good example of what you can build on the platform, but it should only be seen as a learning/building foundation for your work, not as set of production-ready deployable applications. |
